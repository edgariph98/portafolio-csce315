            <p id ="myContribution">
                As a Computer Science student, contributing to the Computer Science field is one of my main goals. But maybe because of a lack of experience or exposure to this field, I might not have that much contribution to this great field.<br> <br>
                One of my different focuses to contribute to this field is to be able to attract many different views into this field, people that can see the potential and opportunities that Computer Science offers, whereas having as many points of view, ideas, and thought processes, and this will eventually lead to a great idea or contribution, this goes back to the saying “Quantity over Quality”. Many people, when choosing a career path, are not automatically attracted to Computer Science automatically. When I was younger, trying to decide what career path to follow, I never view Computer Science as a career path that I wanted to follow, but after being involved in some Computer Science based projects and my first couple computer science classes, I realize how big the possibilities the Computer Science field has to offer, going from its own theoretical advancements all the way to how it can contribute to many other fields. By having as many passionate people about the many possibilities Computer Science can offer leads to many possible contributions in many different ways. <br> <br>
                Another focus of mine is the improvement of the enhancement and performance of a Computer Scientist, this is achieved by giving as many resources and helpful tools for the person, so building the right tools and resources is something that I am extremely passionate about and I always look to contribute in that field.  Some of the many resources I genuinely that I really look forward to contributing is cloud computing and back-end software tools. As stated in my resume I worked at a company called Momentum Enterprises, I worked with the Software Tools Team where I was given a project to essentially develop a Data Recovery System, in case of data loss occurred (major or minor loss). With the development and deployment of this project, I was able to see how this little tool can be so functional to the developers of the company in case so important information was lost and how can they recover it relatively quick, and essentially this is what it got me to be more and more interested about helping other people to achieve more and faster, and I hope I am able to contribute more to this goal in the future even more.
