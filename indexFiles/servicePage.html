                Ever since I was little I grew in very special conditions around me <br>
                very little access to technology and resources to learn more about tech <br>
                so for me it is really important to give back to the community in some type of way<br>
                and that way for me was by getting involved in community service organizations <br>
                <strong>Engineers Serving the Community: </strong> <br>
                this is the organization where I was able to fully engage myself in the world of science and engineering <br>
                as to where most of projects are meant to improve or address a problem in our Student Community, <br>
                and where I am also to participate in different activities <br>
                to encourage younger generations into the world of Tech and Science.
